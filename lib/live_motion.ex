defmodule LiveMotion do
  @moduledoc ~S'''
  LiveMotion provides high performance animations declared on the server and run on the client.

  The main goal of LiveMotion is to make animations as easy as possible by using a simple
  declarative model to define animations. Traditionally animations have to be defined upfront
  using CSS transitions and keyframes. This approach requires a lot of context switching and is
  hard to make dependant on server state.

  With LiveMotion animations can be declared by using the `LiveMotion.motion` component.
  Its's props allow dynamic keyframe animations which can be dependant on the server state.
  These animations are only _declared_ on the server, but are _fully performed on the client_.

  It's just a tiny configuration, which is added via a `data-motion` attribute. This attribute
  is picked up by a LiveView JS Hook which performs the animation using the
  [Motion One](https://motion.dev) animation library. Animations happen using the WebAnimations
  API.

  ## Example

  To declare a simple animation which starts immediately after mount, define the following
  component. This will rotate the popcorn üçø for 360¬∞.

      def render(assigns) do
        ~H"""
        <LiveMotion.motion id="popcorn" animate={[rotate: 360]}>
          <span>üçø</span>
        </LiveMotion.motion>
        """
      end

  To see all supported options, take a look at the documentation of `LiveMotion.motion`.

  ## Manually triggering animations

  Animations can also be triggered by user events like button clicks. These animations do not
  require a round trip to the server and can be defined upfront. Following the previous example:

      def render(assigns) do
        ~H"""
        <div>
          <LiveMotion.motion id="popcorn">
            <span>üçø</span>
          </LiveMotion.motion>

          <button phx-click={LiveMotion.JS.toggle(
            to: "#popcorn",
            [
              in: [opacity: 1],
              out: [opacity: 0]
            ]
          )}>Toggle me</button>
        </div>
        """
      end

  This will toggle the opacity from the `#popcorn` element. See `LiveMotion.JS` for more
  information on how to manually trigger animations.

  ## Limitations

  LiveMotion is still in the early days, so breaking changes are expected. Additionally, there
  are still a few limitations, which will be added in future releases.

  - `LiveMotion.motion` always renders as a `div` element. There are plans on providing
  an api to support rendering any HTML element.
  - Currently standard easing functions (e.g. `ease-in-out`, bezier curves) and spring
  animations are supported. Due to the nature of spring animations, they do not have
  a fixed duration (theoretically they can run indefinetely). When using unmount transition,
  this adds a challenge, as we do not know how long Phoenix LiveView should defer the actual
  removal of the DOM node. For now, we fall back to the maximum supported duration of ten seconds.
  - Support Stagger and glide animations will be added in a later release.
  - Layout animations are not yet supported. Think of animations which automatically move
  items in the correct place after an element is removed which affects the layout.

  use Phoenix.Component

  alias LiveMotion.Motion

  @doc ~S'''
  This is the main component for declaring animations.

  > #### Tip {: .tip}
  >
  > As LiveMotion uses Motion One to perform the animations, keyframes and transition
  > options will be passed directly to Motion One. For a more complete reference,
  > have a look at their documentation of the [animate function](https://motion.dev/dom/animate).

  ## Props

  - `id`: *Required*. A unique dom element id for the component.

  - `initial`: Defines the initial style for the component. Useful when using mount transitions
  and you want the component to have an initial state to animate to. Accepts a `keyframe`
  keyword list.

    If set to `false` it will directly apply the styles defined in the `animate` prop and skip the
    animation.

  - `animate`: Defines the target animation style. Accepts a `keyframe` keyword list.

  - `transition`: Additional options to specify the behaviour of the animation. These are things
  like the easing function, duration and delay.

  - `exit`: The target animation to animate to when the component is unmounted. Accepts
  the same options as `animate` does.

  - `defer`: If set, will defer the animation until it's somehow manually triggered. Use
  in combination with `LiveMotion.JS.show/1`.


  ## Keyframe

  A keyframe is represented by a keyword list defining CSS properties. These can one or multiple
  values. For example:

      [x: 200]

  This will animate the component to 200px on the x axis. As previously mentioned, multiple
  values are supported, too. The following will animate the element on the `x` axis to
  each of the values one after another, spreading the steps equally on the duration.

      [x: [0, 200, 50, 100]]

  You might have noticed that `x` itself is not a valid CSS property. In fact, this is a shorthand
  to make common animation operations easier. `x` eventually translates to the CSS property
  `transform: translateX(200px)`.

  The following shorthands are supported:

  - `x`
  - `y`
  - `y`
  - `scale`
  - `scaleX`
  - `scaleY`
  - `scaleZ`
  - `rotate`
  - `rotateX`
  - `rotateY`
  - `rotateZ`
  - `skewX`
  - `skewY`

  You need to pass the options as a Keyword list and in snake case.

  ## Transition options

  The transition optiona are passed directly to Motion One. The only thing to keep in mind is
  the format when defining `spring` animations. Define a spring animation like this:

      [ease: [spring: [stiffness: 100, damping: 50]]]

  You need to pass the options as a Keyword list and in snake case.
